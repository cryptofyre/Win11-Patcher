# Win11-Patcher
Windows 11 TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot Setup.exe bypass written in Go.

## Compiling
Requires Go (no shit)
Requires a version of 7zip that you can take 7z.exe and 7z.dll from to place alongside the executable.

```
go build
```

Profit.

### 7zip is NOT owned by me and should be respected as its own project.
